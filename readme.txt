You provide free items to users to download? Like you may provide free plugins, themes, UI kits, html templates or any other digital product. so, why don’t you make a email building list? This plugin will help you to collect email address from your users. When you users will want to download, they will need to provide an email address and the downlaod link will be sent to that user’s email. This way, that user can’t provide a wrong email address. The download link will be expired on 24 hours, though this is totally configurable.

This plugin is under further development. So, if you find any bug or you need any feature, please let us know: <a href=“https://duogeek.com/support/forum/duogeek-products/”>https://duogeek.com/support/forum/duogeek-products/</a>
